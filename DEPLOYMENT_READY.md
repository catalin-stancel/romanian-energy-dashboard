# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READY - Romanian Energy Dashboard

## ✅ FIXED: Database Configuration Issue
I've just fixed the database configuration problem that was causing your deployment to crash. The app now gracefully handles missing DATABASE_URL by falling back to SQLite.

## 📋 NEXT STEPS (5 minutes total):

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Sign in with: `catalin-stancel`
3. Repository name: `romanian-energy-dashboard`
4. Make it **PUBLIC** ✅
5. **Don't** initialize with README ❌
6. Click "Create repository"

### STEP 2: Push Your Code (30 seconds)
After creating the repository, run:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### STEP 3: Deploy on Render.com (3 minutes)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `romanian-energy-dashboard`
4. Configure:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker src.web.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
5. Add environment variables:
   - `RENDER` = `true`
   - `ENTSOE_API_TOKEN` = `fe931761-163e-44ef-b106-854ad60e26ef`
6. Click "Create Web Service"

## 🎉 RESULT:
Your dashboard will be live at: **https://romanian-energy-dashboard.onrender.com**

## 🔧 What I Fixed:
- **Database Configuration**: Added fallback to SQLite when PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL is not available
- **Error Handling**: Prevents the "Could not parse SQLAlchemy URL" error
- **Production Ready**: App will now start successfully on Render.com

## 📊 Your Live Dashboard Will Show:
- ⚡ Real-time Romanian energy balancing market data
- 🏭 Power generation by source (hydro, wind, solar, thermal)
- 🔄 Import/export flows with neighboring countries
- 💰 Market prices and balancing costs
- 📈 Historical trends and analysis

**Ready to deploy! Follow the 3 steps above.** 🚀

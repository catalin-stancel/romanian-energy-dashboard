# Romanian Energy Dashboard - Deployment Status

## Current Status: 502 Bad Gateway Error

The deployment is currently showing a 502 Bad Gateway error at:
https://romanian-energy-dashboard.onrender.com

## Recent Changes Made

### ✅ Memory Optimization Complete
1. **Created `requirements-minimal.txt`** - Removed heavy dependencies:
   - ❌ pandas (100MB+)
   - ❌ numpy (50MB+) 
   - ❌ scikit-learn (100MB+)
   - ❌ matplotlib (50MB+)
   - ✅ Kept essential: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, requests, lxml, psycopg2

2. **Created `src/web/optimized_app.py`** - Memory-efficient version:
   - ✅ Database connectivity maintained
   - ✅ API endpoints for data retrieval
   - ✅ JavaScript-based charts (instead of server-side plotting)
   - ✅ Basic Python data processing (instead of pandas)
   - ✅ All essential features preserved

3. **Updated `render.yaml`** configuration:
   - ✅ Uses `requirements-minimal.txt`
   - ✅ Points to `optimized_app.py`
   - ✅ Reduced workers from 4 to 2
   - ✅ All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

## Next Steps to Fix 502 Error

### Option 1: Manual Render Dashboard Update
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Find "romanian-energy-dashboard" service
4. Go to Settings
5. Update Build Command: `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt`
6. Update Start Command: `gunicorn -w 2 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker src.web.optimized_app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
7. Click "Save Changes"
8. Go to "Manual Deploy" and click "Deploy Latest Commit"

### Option 2: Redeploy from Scratch
If the service doesn't exist or needs recreation:
1. Delete existing service (if any)
2. Create new Web Service from GitHub repo
3. Use the updated render.yaml configuration
4. Ensure PostgreSQL database is connected

## Memory Usage Comparison

### Before (Original):
- requirements.txt: ~400MB+ dependencies
- Heavy data science libraries
- Server-side plotting
- Multiple pandas operations

### After (Optimized):
- requirements-minimal.txt: ~50MB dependencies
- Lightweight processing
- Client-side JavaScript charts
- Basic Python data operations
- **Should fit comfortably in 512MB limit**

## Database Configuration

The optimized app includes proper database configuration:
- ✅ PostgreSQL for production (via DATABASE_URL)
- ✅ SQLite fallback for development
- ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Connection pooling optimized

## Features Maintained

Despite memory optimization, all core features are preserved:
- ✅ Real-time energy data collection
- ✅ Dashboard with charts and metrics
- ✅ Import/export flow tracking
- ✅ Power generation monitoring
- ✅ Market price analysis
- ✅ Historical data access
- ✅ API endpoints for data access

## Troubleshooting

If 502 error persists:
1. Check Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set
3. Ensure ENTSOE_API_TOKEN is configured
4. Check if database tables are created properly
5. Monitor memory usage in Render dashboard

## Expected Result

Once deployed correctly, the dashboard should:
- Load within 512MB memory limit
- Display Romanian energy market data
- Show interactive charts
- Provide real-time updates
- Handle database operations efficiently

---

**Status**: Ready for deployment with optimized configuration
**Memory Target**: <512MB (Render free tier limit)
**All Code**: Committed and pushed to GitHub
